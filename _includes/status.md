Please keep in mind that the miniboxing plugin is a beta release, and not a feature-complete, perfect drop-in for your project.<br/><br/> 

We are doing our best to make miniboxing a stable transformation, with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin">nightly</a> <a href="https://travis-ci.org/miniboxing/miniboxing-example">builds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/tree/wip/tests/correctness/resources/miniboxing/tests/compile">hundreds of test cases</a> running every night. Yet, there are <a href="https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues?state=open">bugs we haven&#39;t fixed yet</a>, so don&#39;t be surprised if the plugin fails on some programs. But please do <a href="/issues.html">file bugs</a> for such failures, so we can fix them asap!
