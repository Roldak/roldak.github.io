The miniboxing project is developed by [**Vlad Ureche**](http://vladureche.ro) as a PhD topic under the supervision of [**Martin Odersky**](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/), in the [**Programming Methods Laboratory (LAMP)**](http://lamp.epfl.ch) at [**École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**](http://epfl.ch).

Commiters:

* [Vlad Ureche](http://vladureche.ro) - main developer
* [Cristian Talau](https://github.com/ctalau) - developed the initial prototype, as a semester project
* [Eugene Burmako](https://github.com/xeno-by) - the [value class](https://github.com/miniboxing/valium) plugin based on the [LDL transformation](https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/blob/wip/docs/2014-03-ldl-draft.pdf?raw=true)
* [Aymeric Genet](https://github.com/MelodyLucid) - developing [collection-like benchmarks](https://github.com/MelodyLucid/freezing-ironman) for the miniboxing plugin
* [&lt;your name here&gt;](http://lamp.epfl.ch/teaching/projects/master#faq-527294) - yes, **we need your help**!

Acknowledgements:
