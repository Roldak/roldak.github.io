Miniboxing is a research project at [EPFL](http://lamp.epfl.ch) aimed at improving the performance of generic code running in different Java Virtual Machines. The current implementation is a [Scala compiler](http://scala-lang.org) plugin, which can speed up generics by up to 22x when used for numeric types, such as integer or double. You can learn more about miniboxing by reading the [introduction](intro.html).
