Miniboxing is a research project at [EPFL](http://lamp.epfl.ch) aimed at improving the performance of generic code running on the Java Virtual Machine. Compared to [Scala specialization](http://days2010.scala-lang.org/node/138/151/15-7-E%20-%20Specialization%20-%20Dragos.mp4), miniboxing typically produces 4-100x less bytecode, thus paving the way for [deeply specialized Scala collections](https://github.com/MelodyLucid/freezing-ironman). In turn, miniboxed collections can perform an order of magnitude faster operations for primitive numeric types, such as integers or floating point numbers. 

Miniboxing is implemented as a [Scala compiler](http://scala-lang.org) plugin which you can [easily try on your project](/using-sbt.html).

Taking [`ArrayBuffer.reverse`](/benchmarks.html) as an example:

Where:
 * `generic` is the generic code
 * `miniboxing` is the code generated by our plugin
 * `specialization` is the code generated by the `@specialized` annotation in Scala
 * `monomorphic` is the code specialized by hand

After removing `generic`:

And when comparing the total bytecode size for [spire](https://github.com/non/spire) we see a 4.5x bytecode reduction:

Using miniboxing is as easy as adding an annotation:
{% highlight scala %}
class C[@miniboxed T](val t: T)
{% endhighlight %}

And adding a compiler plugin to your [sbt build](/using_sbt.html) or [command line](/using_out.html).
