Miniboxing is a research project at [EPFL](http://lamp.epfl.ch) aimed at improving the performance of generic code running on the Java Virtual Machine. It is implemented as a [Scala compiler](http://scala-lang.org) plugin which you can [easily try on your project](/using-sbt.html).

Compared to [Scala specialization](http://days2010.scala-lang.org/node/138/151/15-7-E%20-%20Specialization%20-%20Dragos.mp4), miniboxing typically produces 4-100x less bytecode, thus paving the way for deeply specialized Scala collections. [Benchmarks show miniboxing can speed up generic collections by factors of 2x to 22x](/benchmarks.html). The following benchmark shows the miniboxing plugin at work on an array buffer:

Where:

 * `generic` is the generic code
 * `miniboxing` is the code generated by our plugin
 * `specialization` is the code generated by the `@specialized` annotation in Scala
 * `monomorphic` is the code specialized by hand

## What are you waiting for?

Using miniboxing is as easy as adding an annotation:

{% highlight scala %}
class C[@miniboxed T](val t: T)
{% endhighlight %}

and adding a compiler plugin to your [sbt build](/using_sbt.html) or [command line](/using_out.html).

To learn more, see the [introduction to miniboxing](/intro.html) or the [tutorial](/tutorial.html).
