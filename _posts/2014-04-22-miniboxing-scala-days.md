<!-- jekyll don't be stupid -->

That's right! Miniboxing [will be presented](http://www.scaladays.org/#schedule/Miniboxing--Specialization-on-a-Diet) at [the Scala Days conference](http://www.scaladays.org/) in Berlin, 16th-18th of June 2014! 

To have all the coolness in place for Scala Days, we're ramping up both [plugin work](https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/graphs/contributors) and [benchmarking efforts](https://github.com/MelodyLucid/freezing-ironman), thanks to two additions to the miniboxing team: Aymeric ([MelodyLucid on github](https://github.com/MelodyLucid)) and Vlad Haprian ([HaprianVlad on github](https://github.com/HaprianVlad)). 

Hope to see you there!
