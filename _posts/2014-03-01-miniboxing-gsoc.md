We're thrilled to announce Scala has been accepted for [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)! One of the projects we propose is related to the miniboxing plugin: porting the [spire](https://github.com/non/spire) and [breeze](http://www.scalanlp.org/) libraries to use miniboxing. It's a pretty difficult project, but it will have a huge impact on the community.

So we're now looking for students who are familiar with the Scala compiler and/or JVM bytecode and who are not scared of digging into the internals of the [HotSpot Java virtual machine](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/Main) or the [Scala compiler](https://github.com/scala/scala) internals. The project will involve hacking the miniboxing plugin to compile spire and breeze correctly, benchmarking the libraries for performance and tweaking the miniboxing transformation to obtain the best numbers possible.

Consult the [**project page**](http://www.scala-lang.org/gsoc/2014.html#miniboxing_for_breeze_and_spire) and apply by emailing to [**scala-language**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-language).
