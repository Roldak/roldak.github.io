We're thrilled to announce Scala has been accepted for [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)! One of the projects we propose is to develop the miniboxing plugin: namely to help port the [spire](https://github.com/non/spire) and [breeze](http://www.scalanlp.org/) libraries to use the miniboxing transformation.

Applicants should be familiar with the Scala compiler and/or JVM bytecode and should not be scared of digging into the internals of the [HotSpot Java virtual machine](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/Main) or the [Scala compiler](https://github.com/scala/scala) transformations. The project will involve hacking the miniboxing plugin to compile spire and breeze correctly, benchmarking the libraries for performance and tweaking the miniboxing transformation to obtain the best numbers possible. It's a difficult project, but it will make a big impact on the Scala community, as both spire and breeze are highly appreciated libraries!

Consult the [**project page**](http://www.scala-lang.org/gsoc/2014.html#miniboxing_for_breeze_and_spire) and apply by emailing to [**scala-language**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-language).
