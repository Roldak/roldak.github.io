The issue tracker for the miniboxing project is [hosted on github](https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues?state=open). 

Before you jump in, please think how would you, as a developer, like to see the bug:
* minimized (the minimum example still exhibiting the bug)
* self-contained (without requiring outside libraries)
* complete, meaning it contains:
  * all steps necessary to trigger the bug
  * the stack trace
  * the version of Scala and the miniboxing plugin

Let's take two examples:
 * a good bug report, that is likely to get fixed quickly is [#43](https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues/43).
 * a lousy bug report, that will probably still be there in a year, is [#10](https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues/10).
